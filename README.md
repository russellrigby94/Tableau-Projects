# Tableau-Projects

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualisation Portfolio Project

### Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to analyse real-world datasets and communicate insights through clear, interactive visualisations using **Tableau** and **Power BI**. The work focuses on identifying trends, comparisons, and relationships within health and music datasets, transforming raw data into actionable insights for decision-makers.

The project was completed as part of a Data Technician programme and demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills: data exploration, filtering, aggregation, visual design, and insight generation.

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Visualisations

### 🌍 Global Health Analysis (Tableau)

Using the **Gapminder Health dataset**, I analysed global health trends to support a hypothetical international health organisation.

**Key visualisations included:**

* **Life Expectancy by Continent** (bar chart, latest year)
* **Life Expectancy Trends Over Time** for top 5 countries (line chart)
* **Population Distribution by Gender** (interactive pie chart)
* **Life Expectancy vs BMI** (scatter plot with continent segmentation)
* **Custom visual** to extend insights

These visuals were combined into an interactive **Global Health Dashboard**, allowing users to filter by country and explore trends dynamically.

**Key insights:**

* Clear differences in life expectancy across continents
* Long-term improvements in life expectancy for top-performing countries
* Observable relationships between BMI and life expectancy
* Gender population distributions vary significantly by country

### 🎵 Music & Audio Feature Analysis (Tableau)

Using Spotify audio feature data, I explored how musical attributes vary across genres and modes.

**Analysis highlights:**

* Popularity comparisons across music genres
* Danceability differences between **major and minor modes**
* Emotional tone (valence) trends by genre

**Key insights:**

* Pop and rap dominate in popularity, while niche genres rank lower
* Tracks in major mode tend to be more danceable
* Genres like reggae and ska show higher positive valence, while classical and soundtrack genres score lower
